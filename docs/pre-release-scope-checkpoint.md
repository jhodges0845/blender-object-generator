# Pre-release scope checkpoint

This checkpoint began after the Avian leg/Walk correction and now tracks the path to the first public alpha.

## Current status

- The preservation-aware Modify foundation, external inspection/change-file handoff, transactional parameter regeneration, metadata-only animation rename path, and persistent semantic patch architecture are implemented.
- Avian and Human both have provider-owned topology-preserving semantic geometry executors.
- A real Human inspection -> external returned Modify file -> Blender apply round trip has been manually confirmed, including preservation of the existing rig.
- The Blender sidebar is unified under one **Asset Assistant** tab with **Generate / Modify / Rig / Animate / Validate / Export**.
- Human base-geometry quality work is active because the rich Modify proof exposed that semantic operations need stronger reusable facial/body structure to produce useful character identity.
- Release packaging/tag automation exists, but no tag or release should be created until the version/release decision is explicitly approved.

## Confirmed foundation

- Human, Quadruped, and Avian all generate through the shared provider-driven Blender workflow.
- Human has Idle / Walk / Run.
- Quadruped has Idle / Walk / Run.
- Avian has connected legs and feet plus distinct Idle / Walk / Flight clips; Run remains intentionally unsupported.
- Representative target-export coverage exists across Godot, Unity, Unreal, and Cura paths.
- Core/provider anatomy remains host-independent while Blender-specific workflow behavior remains in the Blender adapter.
- Shared Modify code remains provider-neutral; Human and Avian anatomy/semantic interpretation stay inside their providers.

## Modify workflow status

The current workflow is:

`Select generated asset -> Export Inspection File -> edit externally -> Import Change File -> review plan -> Apply Imported Changes -> revalidate`

Implemented behavior includes:

- stable asset/provider identity binding;
- portable inspection/request documents;
- non-mutating import/preview;
- re-inspection/replanning immediately before apply;
- transactional provider-parameter regeneration;
- preservation blockers for ambiguous artist-owned generated relationships;
- generated animation export-name changes without geometry regeneration;
- provider semantic target manifests and executable-operation reporting;
- persistent semantic patch recipes that survive re-inspection and later parameter regeneration;
- Avian semantic geometry execution;
- Human semantic geometry execution, including body, torso, shoulders, head, face, jaw, cheeks, arms, and legs.

Unsupported operations remain blockers rather than silent partial application.

## Human rich-Modify quality checkpoint

The first end-to-end Human external Modify test worked technically but exposed the next product-quality limitation: the generated Human mesh did not initially contain enough facial structure for recognizable character design.

Completed refinement since that checkpoint:

- increased head profile resolution from chin through jaw/cheek/temple/crown;
- added provider semantic targets for `jaw` and `cheeks`;
- added reusable jaw/cheek profiles;
- added neutral facial structure for chin, mouth, nose, eye recess, brow, and forehead;
- completed manual front/side Blender review confirming visible improvement.

Current limitation: the facial landmarks are still broad. Brow, nose bridge/tip, mouth/chin projection, and local facial readability need further reusable refinement before the Human -> specific-character proof is considered visually complete.

## Hair, clothing, accessories, and physics boundary

Hair and clothing are intentionally not ordinary Human geometry edits. They should become first-class attachable components because they may require independent geometry, materials, rigging/weights, collision, and optional physics.

The planned ownership boundary is:

- Human owns body/facial geometry, skeleton/weights, skin/material foundation, and attachment context;
- Hair owns hairstyle geometry/materials plus optional dynamic metadata;
- Clothing owns garment geometry/materials plus rig/weight and optional cloth/collision metadata;
- Accessories own rigid or skinned attachment behavior;
- Blender/Godot/Unity/Unreal adapters translate optional physics intent for their host/engine.

These component operations remain non-executable until persistence, ownership, inspection, validation, and safe apply behavior are implemented.

## UI overhaul status

The main workflow is organized as one ordered Asset Assistant sidebar experience:

`Generate -> Modify -> Rig -> Animate -> Validate -> Export`

Generate starts expanded; later workflow panels begin collapsed. Stable historical panel/operator identifiers remain underneath for compatibility. Animation export-name controls remain under Animate. The structural UI blocker is complete; visual polish remains part of final release review.

## Revised pre-release order

1. ~~Checkpoint provider state and initial documentation sync.~~ Complete.
2. ~~Implement preservation-aware Modify and external file handoff.~~ Complete.
3. ~~Implement persistent provider-aware semantic geometry architecture.~~ Complete for Avian and Human geometry.
4. ~~Complete structural UI overhaul.~~ Complete; final polish remains.
5. Finish the current Human reusable facial/base-geometry quality checkpoint.
6. Define and implement attachable component architecture for hair/clothing/accessories, with physics kept adapter-facing.
7. Run useful end-to-end Avian -> specific bird and Human -> specific character external Modify proofs.
8. Run and close the full cross-provider regression, preservation, architecture, docs, and test-coverage audit.
9. Finish release hardening and run a clean packaged-install smoke test in Blender 5.2.1.
10. Make an explicit version/tag decision and publish the first public alpha only after approval.

Animation polish, exhaustive destination certification, finished anatomy, Quadruped semantic execution, and broader provider expansion remain follow-up work unless testing exposes a release-severity defect.
